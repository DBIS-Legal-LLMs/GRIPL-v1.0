# GRIPL Frontend

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install --force
```

The force is needed to resolve any issue with the new React 19 version.

Then copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and configure the required environment variables. In the case of this frontend you don't need to change anything unless your backend is running on a different URL than `http://localhost:8080`.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
